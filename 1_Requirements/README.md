## INTRODUCTION
 In the wake of pandemic  a sense of euphoria about online voting could be felt in many countries and election expert communities alike. After all, this seemed the logical next frontier of the internet: making elections more convenient, accessible and cheaper.This project aims to solve a few problems associated with the  traditional in-person voting system by devising an online based voting system where the user does not have to go to the polling booth to cast their votes ,instead do it from any desktop/laptop that has internet accessibility.


### BENEFITS

### 1.Vote at any time from anywhere
The online election system increases accessibility for residents abroad and for persons with difficulties in travelling as they can easily cast their votes from any computer system which has internet accessibility.

### 2.Boost participation
The online election system tends to maximize user participation, by allowing them to vote from anywhere and allowing access from different computer systems and from any device that has an internet connection.

### 3.Fast and easy votes tally
Since the tally in online election is run by machines, it is almost certain that it will not have human counting errors and that it will in most cases run faster than a count carried out by persons, so the results of the election will be available faster.

### 4.Increases efficiency
The reduction in organizational and implementation costs significantly increases the efficiency of election management compared to traditional paper election.

This list can go on as there a lot of advantages associated with online election system.
